To address such privacy challenge, a promising method is to use homomorphic encryption to encrypt the user data sent to the cloud, and the cloud performs inference on the ciphertext while the data privacy get protected, leading to a secure MLaaS process. 
However, homomorphic encryption poses a prohibitively demanding computation workload on edge devices. Another relatively lightweight approach adds perturbations or noise to the user data before sending to the cloud host for inference. However, this approach may compromise the prediction accuracy of inference data due to the added noise and cannot fully eliminate the privacy concern depending on the amount of noise added. It is possible the DNNs model need retraining to reclaim the accuracy in practice but may not be feasible because the model may not be accessed. 

In this paper, we focus on a recently emerging brain-inspired AI method called the hyperdimensional computing (HDC). HDC has demonstrated promising capability in a wide range of applications including computer vision~\cite{hersche2020integrating, neubert2021hyperdimensional}, audio~\cite{imani2017voicehd}, robotics~\cite{mitrokhin2019learning}, and natural language processing~\cite{rahimi2016robust}. HDC is inspired by the working mechanism of the human brain which computes embedded and abstract patterns of neural signals rather than actual numbers~\cite{kanerva2009hyperdimensional}. This inspires the formulation of hyperdimensional vectors with fully distributed holographic representation and (pseudo) randomness.
